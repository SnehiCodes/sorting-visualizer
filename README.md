# Sorting Visualizer

**Sorting Visualizer** is an interactive web application that visualizes various sorting algorithms in real-time. It allows users to see how different sorting techniques work on an array of random values. This project is a fantastic educational tool for anyone learning about algorithms or visualizing sorting methods in action. With a sleek, user-friendly interface, it offers visual feedback of common sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch various sorting algorithms in action with dynamically updating bars representing an array of values.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Supports Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.
- **Speed Control**: Customize the speed of the sorting animation using an intuitive slider.
- **Array Size Control**: Adjust the number of elements in the array with a slider, allowing for visualization of small to large datasets.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is built with responsiveness in mind, adapting to different screen sizes for a smooth user experience across devices.
- **Beautiful and Fun UI**: The visual interface is designed to be clean, colorful, and playful, with engaging animations and a vibrant color scheme.
- **Customizable Sorting Algorithm**: Select the sorting algorithm of choice to see it in action.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building a dynamic and interactive frontend.
- **CSS3**: For styling and animations to create an engaging and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For implementing sorting algorithms and handling user interactions.
