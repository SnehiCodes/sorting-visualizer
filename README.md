Sorting Visualizer
Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application that visualizes various sorting algorithms in real-time. It allows users to see how different sorting techniques work on an array of random values. This project is a fantastic educational tool for anyone learning about algorithms or visualizing sorting methods in action. With a sleek, user-friendly interface, it offers visual feedback of common sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.

Features
Real-Time Visualization: Watch various sorting algorithms in action with dynamically updating bars representing an array of values.
Multiple Algorithms: Supports Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.
Speed Control: Customize the speed of the sorting animation using an intuitive slider.
Array Size Control: Adjust the number of elements in the array with a slider, allowing for visualization of small to large datasets.
Responsive Design: The application is built with responsiveness in mind, adapting to different screen sizes for a smooth user experience across devices.
Beautiful and Fun UI: The visual interface is designed to be clean, colorful, and playful, with engaging animations and a vibrant color scheme.
Customizable Sorting Algorithm: Select the sorting algorithm of choice to see it in action.
Technologies Used
React.js: For building a dynamic and interactive frontend.
CSS3: For styling and animations to create an engaging and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript (ES6): For implementing sorting algorithms and handling user interactions.

How to Use
Adjust Array Size: Use the "Array Size" slider to change the number of elements in the array that you wish to sort.
Adjust Speed: Use the "Sorting Speed" slider to control the speed at which the sorting animations play.
Choose Algorithm: Select your preferred sorting algorithm (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, or Selection Sort) from the dropdown.
Generate New Array: Hit the "Generate New Array" button to generate a fresh array for sorting.
Start Sorting: Hit the "Start Sorting" button to begin sorting the array using the selected algorithm.
Algorithms Visualized
Bubble Sort: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm where each element is compared with the next, and swapped if they are in the wrong order.
Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges them back together.
Heap Sort: Based on a binary heap data structure, this algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly removing the largest (or smallest) element and reconstructing the heap.
Quick Sort: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the array around it, and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
Insertion Sort: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.
Selection Sort: A comparison-based algorithm that selects the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
Future Enhancements
Support for more sorting algorithms like Radix Sort, Bucket Sort, etc.
User-customized color schemes for the visualization.
Visualization for Big-O complexity of different algorithms.
Mobile optimization for smaller screens and touch interfaces.
